1. run npm run dev to test it locally

2. I got stuck after trying to create a room. just says 'connecting...'

3. write unit tests to validate the functionality. think harder

4. run and validate the app

5. start the app so I can manual test

6. init git, commit, push, pr

7. merge the pr into main and sync main

8. start the app so I can manual test

9. create new feat branch to work on the hold music. I don't see where I, as host, can play the jepordy think music, during the voiting. lets have the host have to open and closing voiting periods. while the voting period is open the music should autoplay and the host can control (volume/pause/start/stop, etc)

10. merge the pr into main and sync

11. start the app so I can test it

12. ok stop app. so while voting is open hosts needs the features to play the jepordy think music. I don't see that functionality. lets create it and create tests for it.

13. merge the pr into main and sync

14. start the app so I can test it

15. great job! can we get the exact jeopordy think music? the current audio file is not what I wanted. use the audio from this YT video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-l-HvvUbmc

16. yes please, tune the synthesizer to match the actual melody

17. merge the pr into main and sync

18. so ensure that the app supports reading public/audio/hold-music.mp3 as the hold music source else falls back to the synthesized audio

19. merge the pr into main and sync

20. lets add a readme to the project root

21. lets update the attention check lenght to be quicker random 30s-60s

22. right now when a non-host attendee joins the room they are listed twice. lets fix that issue.

23. also on vote reveal the avg should round up or down to a fib number.

24. great commit, push, pr

25. alright lets deploy to railway and make it live

26. ok railway should be logged in

27. I find that the app requires me to enter my name twice before it lets me into the room. lets fix that issue in a feature branch

28. create a prompts.md file and add all of my prompts into that doc. going forward record all my inputs there

29. ok so the app works locally but on railway I get stuck in the 'connecting...' screen when trying to create a room. did we miss anything is the railway setup?

30. Attention checks should only be for those who haven't voted yet during the open voting session. lets create a branch and add this feature.

31. merge pr then work on a feature branch to make the app responsive on mobile devices

32. looks like attention checks are happening outside voting
